# My solution to the Coding Challenges

## About

The repo contains my solutions to [**John Crickett's Coding Challenges**](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro) in [Python](py/README.md) & [Golang](go/README.md).

The challenges are used to improve by understanding of the basics of the both the problem domain and the language specifics. I 've picked the languages which am comfortable with but I also wanted to use to learn a new programming language(Haskell?)

Additionally, I am using these tasks to enhance the testing methods, GitHub actions, level up VSCode skills(as am a **vim**'er)

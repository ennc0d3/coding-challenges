# [Write your own cat Tool](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-cat) - Python



## Solution

The code is structured under [cat]() and is using [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest) as the package manager as I find it better than [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) due to the overhead in learning new package/dependency manager.
